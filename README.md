Small excercise app's to learn Vue.js and Steem API

The first excercise is to make an API call to Steem Condenser "get_followers" and fetch 50 followers filtered by Steem username. I am using Vue.js to display the list but at this point no further logic or error handling has been added. This is  very simple basic app to get started.
